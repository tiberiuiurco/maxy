;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Org Tempo reimplements completions of structure template before
;; point like `org-try-structure-completion' in Org v9.1 and earlier.
;; For example, strings like "<e" at the beginning of the line will be
;; expanded to an example block.
;;
;; All blocks defined in `org-structure-template-alist' are added as
;; Org Tempo shortcuts, in addition to keywords defined in
;; `org-tempo-keywords-alist'.
;;
;; `tempo' can also be used to define more sophisticated keywords
;; completions.  See the section "Additional keywords" below for
;; additional details.
;;
